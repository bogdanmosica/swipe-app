# SwipeApp

This Nx workspace contains the following applications:

- Backend application built with Nest.js for server-side functionality.
- Two front-end applications using Next.js for client-side functionality.

## Installing Postgres and pgAdmin

1. **PostgreSQL Installation**:
   - Download and install PostgreSQL from the official website: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   - During the installation, set up a superuser password and remember it for future use.

2. **pgAdmin Installation**:
   - Download and install pgAdmin from the official website: [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   - Launch pgAdmin after installation and configure it to connect to your PostgreSQL server using the superuser credentials set during the PostgreSQL installation.

## Docker Database Setup

1. **Docker Installation**:
   - If you prefer to use Docker to run your database, install Docker from the official website: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

2. **Running PostgreSQL with Docker**:
   - Once Docker is installed, open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Pull the official PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub:

     ```bash
     docker pull postgres
     ```

   - Run a PostgreSQL container:

     ```bash
     docker run -d --name postgres-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your_password> -p 5432:5432 postgres
     ```

     Replace `<your_password>` with your preferred PostgreSQL password.

3. **Connecting to the Dockerized PostgreSQL**:
   - You can now use the same credentials to connect to the PostgreSQL database either with pgAdmin or in your Nx applications.

## Running Backend and Frontend Apps

1. **Backend Application**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `apps/backend` directory.
   - Install the backend application's dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the backend application:

     ```bash
     npm run start
     ```

   - The backend server will be running on <http://localhost:3000>.

2. **Frontend Applications**:
   - Each front-end application has its own directory within the `apps` folder.
   - To run each front-end application, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the respective front-end app directory (e.g., `apps/frontend-app1`).
   - Install the front-end application's dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the front-end application:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

   - The front-end application will be running on <http://localhost:4000> for app1 and <http://localhost:5000> for app2 (change the port numbers accordingly).

3. **Accessing the Applications**:
   - The backend and front-end applications are now running.
   - You can access the backend API and front-end applications from your browser or API clients like Postman or Insomnia.

   - Frontend App1: <http://localhost:4000>
   - Frontend App2: <http://localhost:5000>
   - Backend API: <http://localhost:3000>

That's it! You have successfully installed PostgreSQL and pgAdmin, set up a Dockerized database, and run the backend and front-end applications in your Nx workspace. Happy coding! ðŸš€

âœ¨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** âœ¨

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

Tasks:

1. nx run database:module:service --name={args.name} --project={args.project} --directory={args.directory} --module={args.module} --no-interactive

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)
