## Installing Postgres and pgAdmin

1. __PostgreSQL Installation__:
   - Download and install PostgreSQL from the official website: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   - During the installation, set up a superuser password and remember it for future use.

1. __pgAdmin Installation__:
   - Download and install pgAdmin from the official website: [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   - Launch pgAdmin after installation and configure it to connect to your PostgreSQL server using the superuser credentials set during the PostgreSQL installation.

## Docker Database Setup

1. __Docker Installation__:
   - If you prefer to use Docker to run your database, install Docker from the official website: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

2. __Running PostgreSQL with Docker__:
   - Once Docker is installed, open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Pull the official PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub:

     ```bash
     docker pull postgres
     ```

   - Run a PostgreSQL container:

     ```bash
     docker run -d --name postgres-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your_password> -p 5432:5432 postgres
     ```

     Replace `<your_password>` with your preferred PostgreSQL password.

3. __Connecting to the Dockerized PostgreSQL__:
   - You can now use the same credentials to connect to the PostgreSQL database either with pgAdmin or in your Nx applications.

## Running Backend and Frontend Apps

1. __Backend Application__:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `apps/backend` directory.
   - Install the backend application's dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the backend application:

     ```bash
     npm run start
     ```

   - The backend server will be running on <http://localhost:3000>.

2. __Frontend Applications__:
   - Each front-end application has its own directory within the `apps` folder.
   - To run each front-end application, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the respective front-end app directory (e.g., `apps/frontend-app1`).
   - Install the front-end application's dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the front-end application:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

   - The front-end application will be running on <http://localhost:4000> for app1 and <http://localhost:5000> for app2 (change the port numbers accordingly).

3. __Accessing the Applications__:
   - The backend and front-end applications are now running.
   - You can access the backend API and front-end applications from your browser or API clients like Postman or Insomnia.

   - Frontend App1: <http://localhost:4000>
   - Frontend App2: <http://localhost:5000>
   - Backend API: <http://localhost:3000>

That's it! You have successfully installed PostgreSQL and pgAdmin, set up a Dockerized database, and run the backend and front-end applications in your Nx workspace. Happy coding! ðŸš€
